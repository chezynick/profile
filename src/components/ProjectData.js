			' Set up a React App using react-router-dom, the app should feature more than 2 pages and include a shopping cart and the ability to add items to it.',
		description:
			' I created a simple bike shop with a landing page, 3 main item pages and a cart page, which breaks down items added and totals the prices. The page uses state to update the cart and to display the number of items added in the Nav bar.',

		name: 'Generation Game',
		proImg: generation,
		assignment:
			' The main goal of this project was to use hooks as well of lots of state, the game needs to know which items have been clicked, keep a score and for bonus points a keep a record of the high score.',
		description:
			' Deciding to base this around the generation games conveyor belt finale, I combined it with a collection of post apocalyptic prizes. I added animations to make the game more challenging, each item was given a clicked value which was changed onClick using state. I had difficulties initially ensuring the click could be anywhere in the item box but overcame the problem with the passing of the item-key in the click function call.',

		description:
			' Probably the hardest one, not to code but to write! Created again using React, deployed using GH-Pages and styled using styled-components which I have found preferable to Sass as it keeps each component seperate and easily re-useable.',

		description:
			' This was built before I learnt React so all of the components are contained in 1 JS file, looking back this looks vast and confusing.Originally built as a book storage as above, I am someone who uses alot of online recipes and found this a more useful subject, after the initial build this was re-designed using factory functions.',
		future:
			' This has been continually in use by myself since inception, i have plans to add a user function with shared storage maybe using firebase. Also swapping across to a React App to allow just partial re-render with each change would be good.',

			' One of earlier projects built to show DOM manipulation skills, this is a browser version somewhere between a sketchpad and an etch-a-sketch.',
		description:
			' This involved setting up an initial grid by looping through a set amount of squares chosen by the user, this provided its own challenges with size issues and the slowing of the browser if using too many squares. After overcoming this I also added the options of colour selection, an eraser and a random colour generator.',

		description:
			' This was my first time working with an API, still in my early days with React I found it a challenge to initiate a re-render when new information was receieved, however I overcame this with use of UseEffect. I also added mobile responsiveness to improve display on smaller mobile screens.',

		description:
			' I spent a long time planning this game, firstly creating the board and player constructors I ended up pretty much doubling up each component before working out how to reduce the code down using the passing of props to specify which player and board was to be used. Having the ships placed vertically as well as horizontally provided an additional problem to overcome.',

			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h3>
				Having worked in Sales and Retail since I was 15 years old, the last 14 years of which have been working
				in Travel for STAâ€™s Round the World telesales team based in Manchester. Not the likeliest candidate for
				a developer I would admit, I have been looking for a new direction for the past few years and this years
				challenges have provided that opportunity for change.{' '}
			</h3>
			<p>
				With the onset of covid I was furloughed in July and in August began my journey on the Odin Project. The
				Odin project is a free open source coding curriculum and is maintained and improved by a team of
				contributors which aims to help it constantly update to the demands of the industry. I began on their
				foundation course working my way through their lessons on HTML and CSS, these are interspersed with
				projects, all of which rather than holding your hand through each project are very much self driven.
				They believe that building projects and actually being hands on is the best way to actually learn, if
				forces you to break any problems down into more manageable sections before moving on.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are a couple of different paths after the foundation course and I decided to go through their full
				stack Javascript course next, starting with Javascript objects, functions, classes before moving onto
				ES6 modules. Finally this Course has worked through React, web pack, async/await, node JS and onto test
				driven development using Jest alongside React.

			<p>
				I have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of working through each project, seeing the knowledge I have
				been taught in each lesson come to use. I have on average spent 7-8 hrs per day working through the
				course supplemented with learning from You Tube and TED talks. The project itself offered various
				differing means of learning each topic from online tutorials to articles.
			</p>
			<h3>
				From my previous line of work I believe many of the skills I learnt there would be easily transferable
				to a career as a developer.{' '}
			</h3>
			<p>
				Team work and collaboration was a massive part of my success at STA, communication between our small
				team could be the difference between making a sale or not, leaving detailed notes in a booking could
				help massively when picking up a colleagues booking. But outside of our immediate team we communicated
				with colleagues in the operations team, suppliers (who numbered in the hundreds), airlines as well as
				our own clients.
			</p>
			<p>
				Meeting clients requirements was the major part of our job but so was managing their expectations,
				inspiring them with ideas of what is possible as well as helping in times of crisis. Working under
				pressure, be it helping a customer stuck at an airport or in times of need, management demands, or just
				busier periods was something I thrived under.
			</p>
			<p>
				As part of my role we were required use numerous computer systems for booking a client trips, as
				mentioned we had numerous suppliers all of whom had their own systems which we had access to. Nearly all
				of the airlines we dealt with had their own way of working which meant the syntax we had to use varied.
				Huge amounts of differing commands needed to be memorised and utilised on a daily basis, this was used
				from simple bookings, to adding on Infants, special meals, client assistance or even adding on musical
				instruments that required their own seats! Once again it was about breaking down the demand, was it
				something I had done before? If so check the previous booking. Could the airline help? Check their agent
				site or speak to them directly, had another colleague come across this problem? Google?
			</p>
			<p>
				Somewhat beating the current trend I have actually worked from home for the previous 11 years, my
				previous role suited this very well. I have excellent time management skills, am good at multitasking
				and work well unsupervised.{' '}
